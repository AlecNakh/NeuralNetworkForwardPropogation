# Simple Neural Network in Python

This project demonstrates the creation and forward propagation of basic neural networks using Python and NumPy. It includes:

- A hard-coded neural network with 3 layers (2 inputs, 2 hidden nodes, 1 output).
- A generalized network generator with customizable architecture.
- Manual or random input options.
- Detailed printouts for each step of the forward propagation.

## Features

- Understand how neural networks process inputs step-by-step.
- Easily modify network size and structure.
- Experiment with different inputs to see how predictions change.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Usage

Run the script to:

- Generate a simple feedforward neural network.
- Choose to manually input data or let the script generate random inputs.
- Observe how inputs propagate through the network and produce an output.

```bash
python neural_network.py
